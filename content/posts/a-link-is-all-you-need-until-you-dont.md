The web has a lot going for it, we coined the term [SLICE](https://paul.kinlan.me/slice-the-web/) to describe the benefits, but at its essence it's the Link. The link is a thing of beauty. It's why I fell in love with the Web. Click. Something new! It's why I still love the web and it's the thing that unique to the medium because the web platform in a lot of cases has a thing at the end of it, yes there is link rot, but you don't have to install anything to get it running if there is something at the far end of that click.

iOS and Android would kill for this. Instagram knows it's power too. The humble link is the creator of worlds.

I was chatting with [Minko Gechev](https://blog.mgechev.com/) about the intersection of AI tooling and the web, and the following thought popped into my mind "If you had a machine that could instantly recall or invent any facet of information, why do you need a link?"

I think about this constantly now.
