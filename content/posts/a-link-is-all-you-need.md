I decided to look for the genesis of the phrase "The web will always win" and it turns out the earliest quote still indexed is a post linking to Dave Winer's post where he doesn't actually directly say it (it's implied).

The web has a lot going for it. We coined the term [SLICE](https://paul.kinlan.me/slice-the-web/) (Secure, Linkable, Indexable, Composable, and Ephemeral) to describe its benefits, but at its purest essence the hyperlink is the thing that makes the web the web. It's a thing of beauty. It's why I fell in love with the Web. Click. Something new! It's why I still love the web and it's the thing that is unique to the medium because the web platform in a lot of cases has a thing at the end of it, yes there is link-rot, but you don't have to install anything to get it running.

But there's something bugging me. It's the over-confidence that the web will weather any storm. "The web will always win", often quoted whenever someone poses that there is an existential threat to the web and the other side doesn't think any of the proposals to address the challenge are needed.

Mobile and the rise of native apps was one of those challenges that I believe was a potential extinction level event for the web. The web as experienced by people didn't work well on mobile and people looked for Apps (they were told it, "There's an app for that"). At the same time billions of people were getting their first computing experience through a mobile device and the web wasn't something they had grown up around, it just didn't even occur to them as a thing that they should do.

Yes, Safari introduced many technologies that would let the web work well on mobile (e.g viewports and media queries are probably the biggest innovations to save the web), but web developers just didn't shift to match the expectation people had from their mobile devices.

From my own personal experience, it wasn't until a Google "mobile-first" push in 2015 that you started to see a change. Now, you can't prove a negative, but it certainly felt like the web was not going to win.

Now as I look at my own usage of LLMs, there is a change in how I use the web and I am uneasy and I've not been able to quite put my finger on it. Yes, as the cost of creating content drops because people use LLMs, it enables a lot more low-quality content to be created, but the only way that you will see this content is if you navigate to it.

It's the link that I am worried about.

I was chatting with a colleague about the intersection of AI tooling and the web and the following thought popped into my mind "If you had a machine that could instantly recall or create any facet of information, do you need a link?"

I think about this constantly.

It doesn't feel a million miles away from the original definition of hypertext. The idea that you could have a machine that could recall any piece of information and then connect it with any other piece of text.

[Transclusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion), specifically feel pretty close.

> In computer science, transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by reference via hypertext. Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user.[1] The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places. _The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places._

Emphasis mine.

The way that we, people, use links is as a way of saying "I think this is important". "I think this is related or has more context". "I think you should look at this". I just don't know how this plays out in a world where the answer is generated.

What we know as a hyperlink, a thin blue line underneath some text made by wrapping it in an `<a>` tag connecting two documents together is a construct of the technology that renders web pages. I struggle to see how this works in a world where the answer is generated and the inference between two concepts, or many documents can just be included by the LLM. It feels like the 1:1 nature of a link is changing.

Unlike Page Rank which to my understanding has the link imply some level of authority, its also unclear to me if this is of any importance to a LLM. Is the link just a way to point a web-crawler to another page so it can be ingested? If so, then a way to not have a LLM tool not ingest your content is to not have it discoverable? Do you put all of your content behind a paywall?

I'm still bullish on the web. The link is still something that will help every person or machine discover the new content and experiences. The link can still point to content in the open or content that is private behind a login and enable instant access to any experience. So we still have that for now, but in is a world where [LLMs become the super app](/super-apps/) because they can recall and generate content and functionality in an instant, then what next?

Maybe the web needs a new way to think about the link that makes running in the browser even more compelling. That's certainly something that I want to explore more in the future.
