- Nature of hyperlinks

  - Summarize a the content behind a link
  - Can we add actions to link? so you got to the page and a script or an llm does something.. talk about the risks (buy this etc). point out that the thing I want to link to is after a heap of actions.... Can we record those actions and play them back. Ted Nelson article is in a tool that's behind 5 pages of an object.
  - Merge the content of a link into the current page or paragraph, so you can see the content without leaving the page.

- Nature of hypermedia
  - Get embeddings from videos, images, audio and text. Store them and index them. Then for any frame find related content either the user has been to or that is on the web.
